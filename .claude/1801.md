This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. This is a continuation of a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary indicates the user was working on fixing ESLint errors in a VS Code extension project called "copy-info-with-context".

2. The todo list shows the task breakdown:
   - Fix hashingUtils.test.ts - remove async keywords from 61 test functions (in_progress)
   - Verify ESLint errors are resolved in hashingUtils.test.ts (pending)
   - Fix remaining test files (validators.test.ts, extension.test.ts, unit-tests.ts, vscode-mock.ts) (pending)
   - Fix command files (~11 errors) (pending)
   - Fix warnings (~159 warnings) (pending)

3. The user message says "continue and I have removed the 61 async keywords" - indicating they manually removed the async keywords from the test functions.

4. The system reminders show the file hashingUtils.test.ts was modified - all test functions now use synchronous callbacks like `test('generates consistent hashes for same input', () => {` instead of `test('generates consistent hashes for same input', async () => {`

5. My action was to run ESLint on the hashingUtils.test.ts file to verify if errors were resolved.

6. The ESLint output shows that there are still 48+ errors - all are `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` errors. This indicates that the `test()` function itself returns a Promise, and even though the callback is synchronous, ESLint still sees floating promises at each `test()` call.

7. The issue is that the Mocha/Node test framework's `test()` function returns a Promise, and without the describe block callbacks being async and awaiting the tests, these are "floating promises". This is a common issue with test frameworks.

The files shown in the system reminders contain the full hashingUtils.test.ts content after modification - it has 540 lines with 61 test functions across multiple describe blocks testing:
- Deterministic Hash Generation
- Email Hashing
- Phone Number Hashing
- Credit Card Hashing
- SSN Hashing
- Date of Birth Hashing
- Address Hashing
- Generic Hashing
- HASH_FUNCTIONS Registry
- getHashFunction Helper
- Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Performance Tests
- Hash Collision Resistance

The current problem is that even after removing async keywords from test functions, ESLint still reports floating promise errors because the `test()` calls themselves return promises that aren't being handled.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user is working on fixing ESLint errors in a VS Code extension project called "copy-info-with-context". The main task is to fix ESLint errors across multiple files, starting with hashingUtils.test.ts which had 61 test functions with unnecessary `async` keywords (causing `@typescript-eslint/require-await` errors). The user manually removed the async keywords and asked to continue with the fix verification and remaining tasks.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - ESLint with TypeScript rules (`@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`, `@typescript-eslint/require-await`)
   - VS Code extension testing with Mocha test framework
   - Node.js assert module for testing
   - Deterministic hashing utilities for PII data (email, phone, credit card, SSN, DOB, address)
   - Test file patterns using `describe()` and `test()` blocks

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - `c:\Users\donald.chan\Documents\Github\copy-info-with-context\src\test\hashingUtils.test.ts`
     - Main test file being fixed - contains 61 test functions across 13 describe blocks
     - User manually removed all `async` keywords from test callbacks
     - Tests cover: generateDeterministicHash, hashEmail, hashPhone, hashCreditCard, hashSSN, hashDateOfBirth, hashAddress, hashGeneric, HASH_FUNCTIONS registry, getHashFunction helper
     - Example test pattern after fix:
       ```typescript
       test('generates consistent hashes for same input', () => {
           const value = 'test@example.com';
           const hash1 = generateDeterministicHash(value);
           const hash2 = generateDeterministicHash(value);
           assert.equal(hash1, hash2, 'Same input should produce same hash');
       });
       ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Original error**: 61 `@typescript-eslint/require-await` errors - async functions with no await
     - Fix: User manually removed all `async` keywords from test callbacks
   - **New error discovered**: 48+ `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` errors remain
     - The `test()` function calls themselves return Promises that ESLint flags as unhandled
     - This needs to be addressed (either by ESLint config changes or by handling the promises)

5. Problem Solving:
   - The user's manual removal of async keywords solved the `require-await` errors
   - However, a new issue emerged: the `test()` function returns a Promise, causing `no-floating-promises` errors
   - This is a common pattern issue with test frameworks where ESLint's strict promise handling conflicts with test runner conventions

6. All user messages:
   - "continue and I have removed the 61 async keywords"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Resolve remaining ESLint errors in hashingUtils.test.ts (floating promises)
   - Fix remaining test files (validators.test.ts, extension.test.ts, unit-tests.ts, vscode-mock.ts)
   - Fix command files (~11 errors)
   - Fix warnings (~159 warnings)

8. Current Work:
   Immediately before the summary request, I ran ESLint on `hashingUtils.test.ts` to verify if the async keyword removal fixed the errors. The output showed 48+ `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` errors remain at each `test()` call (lines 17, 25, 32, 40, 51, 59, 68, 75, 82, 90, 97, 106, etc.). The floating promises issue needs to be resolved - either by disabling the rule for test files, wrapping test calls, or another approach.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Fix the `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` errors in hashingUtils.test.ts. The most practical solution is likely to disable this ESLint rule for test files in the ESLint configuration, as test frameworks handle promise resolution internally. This aligns with the user's request to "continue" fixing ESLint errors.

   User's exact message: "continue and I have removed the 61 async keywords"
   
   Last action: Ran `npx eslint src/test/hashingUtils.test.ts` which returned 48+ floating promise errors.
